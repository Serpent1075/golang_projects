Increase the depth of the network: 
One way to make a CNN more complex is to increase the depth of the network by adding more layers. 
For example, you could add additional convolutional and pooling layers to capture more complex patterns in the input data.

Use more complex activation functions: 
Instead of using the ReLU activation function, which is commonly used in CNNs, 
you could experiment with other activation functions like Leaky ReLU, ELU, or SELU, which may improve the performance of the network.

Use more advanced regularization techniques: 
In addition to the dropout regularization used in the example code, 
you could experiment with other regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization, 
which penalize large weights in the network, or batch normalization, 
which normalizes the inputs to each layer to help reduce overfitting.

Use pre-trained models: 
Instead of training a CNN from scratch, you could use a pre-trained model like VGG, ResNet, or Inception, 
which have been trained on large datasets like ImageNet and can be fine-tuned for your specific problem.

Use more complex data: 
The complexity of the input data can also affect the complexity of the CNN. 
For example, if you are working with medical images, which may have many different structures and textures, 
you may need a more complex network to capture these features.

Use more complex loss functions: 
In addition to the cross-entropy loss used in the example code, 
you could experiment with other loss functions like the mean squared error (MSE) loss or the categorical hinge loss, 
which may be better suited for certain problems.
