The difference between this implementation of the MSE loss function and the original formula is simply the indexing and notation. 
The implementation is computing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and true values across all samples 
and then dividing by the total number of samples to get the average.

The original formula is the same, but it is written in a more concise mathematical notation, 
using the summation symbol (sum) to represent the sum over all samples, and the superscript 2 to represent squaring.



Use a more efficient activation function: 
The sigmoid activation function used in the RNN implementation is not very efficient for large neural networks, 
as it can cause the vanishing gradient problem, which can make training slow or even impossible. 
One alternative is to use the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, 
which is more efficient and has been shown to work well in many deep learning applications.

Use mini-batch training: In the current implementation, the RNN is trained on the entire dataset at once, 
which can be slow and memory-intensive for large datasets. A better approach is to use mini-batch training, w
here the RNN is trained on smaller subsets of the data, which reduces memory usage and allows for faster convergence.

Use a more complex RNN architecture: The current RNN implementation is a simple RNN with one hidden layer. 
To improve performance, you may want to consider using a more complex RNN architecture, 
such as a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which are better at handling long-term dependencies
 and have been shown to work well in many applications.

Use dropout or regularization: To prevent overfitting, 
you may want to consider using dropout or regularization techniques, 
such as L1 or L2 regularization, which can help to reduce the complexity of the model 
and prevent overfitting on the training data.

Use a different optimization algorithm: The current implementation 
uses simple gradient descent to optimize the weights and biases of the RNN. 
However, there are many other optimization algorithms that can work better for RNNs, 
such as Adam or RMSprop, which can help to accelerate training and improve performance.
